Restless Simulator documentation
################################

This repository contains a qutrit restless simulator that is compatible with Qiskit. The simulator
is used to execute circuits with leakage to the second-excited state :math:`\ket{2}` with and
without restless circuit execution. The simulator supports arbitrary qutrit unitary gates and CPTP
maps, but currently only supports single-qutrit circuits.
